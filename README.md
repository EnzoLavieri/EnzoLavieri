# Olá, seja bem-vendo ao meu perfil do GitHub!

👨‍💻  I’m currently doing a web site for my scout group.<br>
🙋‍♂️  If you want to talk to me, don't hesitate to send me an email, I'll answer ASAP!<br> 
♥   I've been a Scout for 6 years, and it's one of the best things that ever happened to me. <br>
👨‍🎓  I am learning and I know a little bit of C, and in the future I want to learn HTML, CSS and JS. <br> 
😸Last but not least I'm a software engineering student at Unicesumar, here you can find my projects, college work, and other things...
